# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

Build a browser-based exercise form checker in 4 phases: start with camera access and basic UI, add pose detection with skeleton overlay, implement video recording, then add exercise-specific form alerts for squats and push-ups.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Working camera preview with responsive layout and basic auth
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CAM-01, CAM-02, CAM-03, AUTH-01
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project setup (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- [x] 01-02: Camera access with permission UX
- [x] 01-03: Password gate and responsive layout

### Phase 2: Pose Detection

**Goal**: Real-time skeleton overlay with general posture alerts
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: POSE-01, POSE-02, CAM-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: MediaPipe integration and skeleton drawing
- [x] 02-02: General posture detection and audio/visual alerts

### Phase 3: Recording

**Goal**: Video recording with local download
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (camera access)
**Requirements**: REC-01, REC-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: MediaRecorder integration with start/stop
- [x] 03-02: Local download functionality

### Phase 4: Exercise Alerts

**Goal**: Specific form alerts for squats and push-ups
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (pose detection)
**Requirements**: POSE-03, POSE-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Squat form detection (knee angle, back, depth)
- [x] 04-02: Push-up form detection (alignment, elbow, depth)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin for native Vite integration
- CDN-hosted MediaPipe models for smaller bundle size
- Custom hooks pattern for media API encapsulation (useCamera, useAuth, usePoseDetection, usePostureAlerts, useExerciseAlerts, useRecording)
- Mirror video horizontally for front camera only
- 500ms debounce on posture alerts, 2s throttle on audio alerts
- 100 degrees knee angle threshold for proper squat depth
- 100 degrees elbow angle threshold for proper push-up depth
- Side-view camera recommended for best push-up detection

**Issues Resolved:**
- None significant

**Issues Deferred:**
- S3 upload functionality (v2 feature)
- Recording history with IndexedDB (v2 feature)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
