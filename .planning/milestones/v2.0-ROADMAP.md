# Milestone v2.0: Cloud Backup

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 6
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Cloud backup to S3 — configure your own bucket, upload recordings with progress tracking and retry logic.

## Phases

### Phase 6: S3 Upload

**Goal**: Direct browser-to-S3 uploads with progress UI and retry logic
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (Recording History)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: S3 Upload Foundation — types, upload utility with retry, useS3Upload hook
- [x] 06-02: UI Integration — S3ConfigModal, upload buttons in RecordingList, progress indicators

**Key Files Created:**
- `src/types/s3.ts` - S3Config, UploadProgress, UploadStatus, UploadResult types
- `src/utils/s3Upload.ts` - Upload utility with XMLHttpRequest progress and exponential backoff retry
- `src/hooks/useS3Upload.ts` - React hook for config and upload queue state management
- `src/components/S3ConfigModal.tsx` - Modal for entering S3 bucket credentials

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/components/RecordingList.tsx` - Added S3 upload buttons per recording with status indicators
- `src/components/CameraPreview.tsx` - Wired up useS3Upload hook and S3ConfigModal

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- XMLHttpRequest over AWS SDK - simpler for public bucket PUT, native progress events, no extra dependency
- Exponential backoff retry (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s) for transient failures
- localStorage for S3 config persistence (user-provided credentials)
- Upload status state machine: disabled/ready/uploading/complete/failed

**User Setup Required:**
- AWS S3 bucket with public write access
- CORS policy configured for browser PUT requests
- See `.planning/phases/06-s3-upload/06-USER-SETUP.md` for details

**Issues Resolved:**
- Rate limit during plan 06-02 execution (resumed successfully)
- Build error from mismatched prop name (fixed)

**Issues Deferred:**
None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None.
