## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- CSS media queries for orientation (more performant than JS state)
- Hide fullscreen button on unsupported browsers (better than disabled/error)
- Yellow (#FFCC00) for warnings, red (#FF3333) for errors
- Glow effect with semi-transparent larger circle for visibility
- Landmarks drawn on top of normal skeleton

**Issues Resolved:**
- Video dimensions reporting 0x0 initially on some browsers (fixed with fallback polling)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
