# Milestone v2.3: Continuous Recording UX

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-21
**Phases:** 12-14
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Seamless continuous recording that auto-starts on camera load with visual status indicator and resilient upload handling including date-based folder organization and automatic retry with exponential backoff.

## Phases

### Phase 12: Auto-Start Recording

**Goal**: Auto-start continuous recording when camera preview loads, stop on close/refresh
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Continuous Recording infrastructure)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Auto-start continuous recording

**Details:**
- Added autoStart option to useContinuousRecording hook using options object pattern
- Recording begins automatically when camera stream becomes available
- Removed toggle button for seamless UX (status indicator added in Phase 13)
- visibilitychange handling preserved for page exit

### Phase 13: Status Indicator

**Goal**: Replace continuous recording button with status icon (green=active, yellow=uploading, orange=retrying, grey=inactive)
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Status indicator component

**Details:**
- Created ContinuousRecordingStatus component with state-driven display
- Color coding: green (recording with pulse), yellow (uploading with progress), orange (retrying), grey (idle/paused), red (error)
- Positioned in top-left status area matching existing indicator styling
- Pill shape with text-xs font-medium for visual consistency

### Phase 14: Resilient Upload

**Goal**: Auto-retry uploads with reconnection handling, organize by date folders (2026-01-21/session-abc/chunk-0001.webm)
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: Resilient upload with date folders and retry logic

**Details:**
- Upload paths include date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD/sessionId/chunk-NNNN.webm)
- Failed uploads retry with exponential backoff (max 5 attempts per chunk)
- Added retryCount field to RecordingChunk type for tracking attempts
- Network reconnection (online event) triggers automatic retry of pending chunks
- Status indicator shows "Retrying X/Y" with orange background during retries

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Removed all continuous recording UI temporarily, re-added as read-only status indicator
- Used options object pattern for useContinuousRecording extensibility
- Max 5 retries per chunk to avoid infinite retry loops
- Orange color for retry state to distinguish from regular yellow upload
- Window 'online' event for network reconnection detection
- Date folder format using toISOString().split('T')[0]

**Issues Resolved:**
- None (clean implementation)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
